## Approach

My approach for this project was based on creating a game of Trivia that pulled questions from an API. These questions are displayed to the user on screen and the user is given two choices (True/False). After the user presses one of the buttons, the program matches it with the right answer in the back-end and determines whether the user got the answer right or not. If the user gets the answer correct, the program adds a point to the user's score at the bottom, if the user gets an answer wrong, the user gets no points added. 

I took a very uncoventional approach where I started creating the functions before setting the layout for the game. This ended up creating some setbacks and some limitations for me as I progressed in the created the program. Halfway through creating the game, I ended up changing my approach and I finished some of the last elements by created proper functions and calling them as needed. This gave me a lot of more flexibility in editing my code, and definitly looked a lot cleaner. The functions that I didn't end up using were commented out and put at the bottom of the JavaScript file 

I also used Notion App for my project's management, it provided me a framework to follow as a I progressed through creating the program. It allowed me to update my status as I progressed through each task and whenever I would come back to work on the app I would know where I ended and where I needed to start each day. It also kept my JavaScript notes/comments clean and concise. 


## Version 2

In the future, I'd like to add multiple choice questions and drag and drop functionality.
